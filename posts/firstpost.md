					<mono>After missing out on the signup windows of various events and then only to read of interesting events after they happened, I set up this small collection of races happening throughout the year. Aiming to provide all the information needed to find and signup in plenty of time, and endulge in all things bike race.</mono>
						<P>With a lot of messing around, this site now runs at zero cost which is great because, it means everything is free to view and use. But as a bonus for charity, I offer paid event sponsorships, with 100% going to a cancer charity of your choice. If your interested in getting your event listed, please get in contact.</p>
